## Abstract

Just over a year ago, Apple launched a new programming language in the form of Swift: a fast​​, ​​safe​​ and ​​modern​​ pragmatic language following current ideas in language design that is shortly to be open-sourced. This talk will cover both the basics of the language as well discussion of the relevance of Swift to the non-Apple world within the context of new paradigms: protocol-oriented design and functional reactive programming.
